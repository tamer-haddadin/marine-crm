1. Quotation Performance and Conversion Trends:

The total number of quotations in the period is 11, out of which 3 were confirmed and 1 was declined, leaving 7 quotations open. The active quotations excluding those declined stand at 10. With a conversion rate of 30.00%, this indicates that approximately one-third of the active quotations are being successfully converted into confirmed business. This conversion rate suggests a moderate level of success in turning prospective interest into actual policies. There may be room to improve this number by identifying patterns in the declined or open quotations and addressing potential client concerns or enhancing value propositions.

2. New vs Renewal Business Comparison:

The business performance data demonstrates a significant inclination towards new business orders, with 57 new business orders compared to 18 renewal orders. This indicates a strong focus or strength in acquiring new clients. However, renewal orders being only a fraction of the new business orders could suggest a need to improve retention strategies to maintain and possibly increase long-term customer loyalty.

3. Premium Distribution Between New and Renewal Business:

Despite the higher number of new business orders, the renewal premium, at 3164388.30, closely rivals the new business premium, which is 3078245.97. This suggests that the renewal policies, though fewer in number, are of higher or stable value compared to new policies. The total premium collected sums up to 6242634.27, showcasing a balanced revenue stream from both new and old clientele. Recognizing this balance in premium distribution encourages nurturing the existing client base further for sustainability.

4. Key Marine Product Types and Their Performance:

While the data does not specify types of marine products, performance could be inferred by analyzing which product types most quotations fall under, especially those confirmed. Diving deeper into which products contribute most significantly to new and renewal premiums can identify potential growth segments or areas requiring additional strategic focus.

5. Recommendations for Business Growth:

Given the current statistics, efforts should be made to enhance the effectiveness of conversion strategies to increase the percentage from the current 30.00%. Emphasizing customer satisfaction and retention could help bolster the number of renewal orders, thereby stabilizing income and reducing dependency on new business. Moreover, expanding product offerings or tailoring products to meet specific market needs might capture more new clients and differentiate from competitors. Continuous analysis of declined quotations will provide insights into potential areas of improvement in service or offerings.
