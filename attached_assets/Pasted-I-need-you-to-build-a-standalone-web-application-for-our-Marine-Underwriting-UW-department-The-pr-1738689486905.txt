I need you to build a standalone web application for our Marine Underwriting (UW) department. The primary purpose of this app is to record firm orders, track their status, and manage follow-ups with automated reminders. Additionally, the app should integrate a large language model (LLM) (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-4) to generate follow-up email drafts and status summaries.

Key Features & Requirements:

Firm Order Entry & Tracking:

A form for entering new firm orders with details such as broker name, order date, and any other relevant information.
Each order should have a status that can be updated (e.g., "Firm Order Received," "COI Issued," "KYC Pending," "KYC Completed," "Policy Issued").
Record a log of status changes with timestamps and optional notes.
Automated Reminders:

Implement a background scheduler (e.g., using cron or an equivalent scheduling library) to check for orders that have been in a specific status (for example, "COI Issued") for longer than a configurable threshold (e.g., 48 hours).
When an order exceeds the allowed time in a status, trigger a reminder notification. The reminder should include an LLM-generated draft message (see LLM Integration below).
LLM Integration:

Integrate with an LLM API (e.g., OpenAI’s GPT-4) to generate:
A draft follow-up email for orders that are pending (for example, for orders stuck in "COI Issued" status without KYC updates).
Summary reports of order statuses if needed.
The LLM-generated content should be accessible from the order detail view so that users can review and edit it before sending.
User Interface (Frontend):

Develop a responsive dashboard displaying all orders with filtering and search capabilities.
Provide forms for creating new orders and updating existing orders.
Display notifications or alerts for orders that require follow-up.
Use a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Angular, or Vue.js).
Backend & API:

Build an API to support CRUD operations on orders and status logs.
Implement endpoints such as:
POST /orders – Create a new firm order.
GET /orders – List and filter orders.
PUT /orders/:id – Update an order (including status updates).
GET /orders/:id/logs – Retrieve the status log for an order.
Develop a scheduler service that runs periodically to check orders and trigger reminders.
Database:

Use a relational (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) to store orders and status logs.
Design a schema with tables/collections for orders (fields: id, broker_name, order_date, status, LLM_suggestion, last_updated, etc.) and status logs (fields: id, order_id, status, timestamp, notes).
Deployment & Security:

Ensure API keys (especially for the LLM) are stored securely (e.g., in environment variables).
Provide basic authentication for the app.
The app should be deployable on an internal server or cloud platform.
Additional Details:

Please include error handling and logging.
Write clean, modular code and include comments where necessary.
Provide instructions on how to set up and run the app locally.
If possible, include unit tests for critical functionalities (e.g., the scheduler and API endpoints).
